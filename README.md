# ML_DecisionTree
Music Genre Recommendation Engine using Decision Trees
This repository implements a music genre recommendation engine trained on a dataset of musical features. It utilizes a decision tree classifier model for fast and accurate predictions.

Features:
1. Prediction accuracy: Trained on a large dataset for accurate genre prediction.
2. Model portability: Saved as a joblib file for seamless deployment and integration.
3. Fast inference: Predicts genres in milliseconds, even for millions of entries.
4. Model visualization: Generates a graphical representation of the decision tree logic for transparency.

Technical Stack:
1. pandas: Efficient data manipulation and analysis.
2. scikit-learn: Decision tree classifier implementation and visualization.
3. joblib: Model serialization and deserialization.

Key Benefits:
1. Discover new music based on your preferred genres.
2. Enhance music streaming platforms with personalized recommendations.
3. Streamline music categorization and organization.

Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).
3. Run the included scripts for training and prediction.
4. Explore the provided decision tree visualization.

Further Development:
1. Integrate the model with a music streaming API for real-time recommendations.
2. Explore other algorithms for comparison and potential improvements.
3. Train the model on additional features for richer predictions.

This description highlights the key functionalities, technical aspects, and benefits of your music genre recommendation engine. It provides clear instructions for getting started and encourages further exploration and development.
